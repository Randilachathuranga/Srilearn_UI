📘 Project Description

SriLearn is a role-based educational management system that connects students, teachers, institutes, and administrators through a unified web platform. The system allows students to enroll in classes, access learning materials, manage fee payments, and communicate with teachers and institutes. Teachers and institutions can schedule classes, upload materials, post advertisements, manage subscriptions, and interact with students.

SriLearn is especially useful for individual class teachers, offering them the ability to post advertisements and promote their classes effectively to attract students. The platform supports both normal and premium teachers, with premium features like scheduling personalized sessions and issuing discounts.
